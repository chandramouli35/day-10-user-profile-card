# Day 10 – Interactive Profile Card with Toggle Edit Mode and Tailwind Transitions

This project is part of my 150-day developer preparation journey, now entering double digits with a focus on frontend UX engineering. On Day 10, I built a responsive user profile card that switches between view and edit mode using React state logic and Tailwind-powered transitions.

## ✅ What I Practiced:
- useState to control toggle between view/edit modes
- Controlled input fields with dynamic state updates
- Conditional rendering based on mode
- Input validation (non-empty name, valid email format)
- Tailwind CSS transitions, hover effects, and spacing utilities
- Autofocus logic on edit and toast feedback on save

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered:
- State-driven UI toggling
- Component abstraction: separating display and edit modes
- Reusable ProfileCard component with clean layout
- UX feedback patterns: transitions, button states, error hints

## 🛠 Features:
- Displays user info: avatar, name, email, role, bio
- Edit mode toggles with button and updates state on submit
- Validates input fields before saving
- Styled with Tailwind for spacing, typography, and responsiveness
- Optional toast alert for confirmation

## ⚙️ Tech Stack:
- React.js (Hooks and component structure)
- Tailwind CSS
- useState and conditional rendering
- Optional: useEffect for auto focus

## 🔥 Why This Matters:
Modern SaaS platforms require intuitive, user-friendly profile components — ones that feel dynamic, validate user input, and transition smoothly. Today’s structure aligns with production-ready UI decisions seen across dashboards and account settings.

> Day 10 complete. Every transition and input sync pushes my UI fundamentals into polished, product-grade code.
